This repository contains the *Conditional game data analysis tool (CGDAT)*. It can be used to load in a csv file and filter this file based on some conditions. Further you can input a file with begin and end times to specify on which sections the analysis has to be performed. I created this tool for a friend of mine to help him with the soccer game data analysis.
