### Functions
This repository can be used to perform a simple csv game data filtering. The tool can filter a input data file based on:

* Conditions:
    * Example: Speed > 10 & Acceleration < 5
* A time section file:
    * A file containing a `Start Time` and `End Time` column specifying the sections where you want to apply the condition filter.
* Player name:
    * In the gui you can specify for which players you want to conduct the analysis. For this option to work the `input_data.csv` file needs to contain a `Name` column.


Further you can add also add a safety padding to the data filtering. Meaning that the program will also include a number of samples before and after the specified conditions are met.

### Console commands
This package also installs some additional console commands:

* `cgdat-gui` - This will launch the CGDAT gui.
* `cgdat-shortcut` - This will create a shortcut to launch the GUI on your desktop folder.

## Further documentation
Additional documentation can be loaded in the GUI by clicking the `documentation` option in the help menu or pressing the `F2` shortcut.
