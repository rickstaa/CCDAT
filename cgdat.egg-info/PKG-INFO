Description: This repository contains the Conditional game data analysis tool (CGDAT). It can be used to load in a csv file and filter this file based on some conditions. Further, you can filter the file based on (Player name, Time sections) and you can add a time padding to the output result.
        
        # How to use
        1. Download the zip.
        2. Click the `installer.bat` file in the main cgdat folder.
        3. A shortcut will be created. You can run the cgdat tool by clicking on this shortcut.
            - This shortcut can be placed anywhere but will only work as long as you do not move the cgdat folder.
        
        # Notes
        At the moment the package doesn't function as a fully independent package. For this to work I need to solve some relative import issues between the sphinx documentation tool and the python scripts.
